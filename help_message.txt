Welcome to our paint !

I will introduce you some tips to use in this feature:

First of all in the left up corner you have 3 differents buttons :
    - File
    - Edit
    - Help (you just clicked on it)

In the file part, you can save your drawing with a default name or with a custom name with the button "save as".
You can also create a new file and reset your drawing by pressing "new_file".

Next there is the Edit part. You can switch on the eraser if you want to by pressing the "eraser" button. You can
also change the thickness of your pencil using "size +" and "size -".

Finally the help button but i think your already know what it means XD.

In the middle of the screen, you can see a white rectangle : it's where you can do whatever you like !
You just have to press the left button of your mouse.

But this is a bit boring to paint only in black is it not ? Let me introduce colors ! In the right of your window,
there is 8 buttons with differents colors. By pressing them, you can switch the color of your pencil !

I hope you enjoy our paint !
